# Equivalent electrical circuit recognition forimpedance spectroscopy data via machine learning

This repositery contains the dataset used to train machine learning algorithms to recognize the equivalent model circuit able to fit a given Nyquist plot.

The "data/" folder contains the raw data directly extracted from the plots and interpolated to 40 points, automatically generated plot of each curve extracted and the final files used to train the algorithms.



The "reference.pdf" file contains a list of all papers from which at least one Nyquist plot was extracted.
